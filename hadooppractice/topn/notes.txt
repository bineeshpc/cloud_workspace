// Sorting problem
// select * from table order by followers;

// map phase
// reduce phase
// M -> R
// each mapper works on a subset of data
// mappers run in parallel seeing a subset of the data
// mapper sends top n to reducer
// reducer calculates overall top n
// olympics
// top 3 from each country
// and then the overall top 3 are found
// a single reducer should be used
// 2 reducers is like having 2 olympics
// total order partitioning using multiple reducers (advanced topic)
